##Synopsis

The documentation for Wikidata can be daunting. This project aims to organize the great material that's out there and create a Hacker's Map that details step-by-step how to get started. The Hacker's Map will then be used as part of a mini-campaign to increase participation in the Wikidata project.
<!--
Short summary describing your project: what it means to accomplish, and how it will benefit MediaWiki or Wikimedia projects such as Wikipedia.

##Deliverables
The first half of the project will involve building the Hacker's Map byt organizing exisiting docs and creating new ones as needed. The second half of the project will center around deploying the map and publicizing it to draw in new editors/hackers and use their feedback as part of the testing/refactoring phase.
<br />*April 21 - May 18:**     On-ramping, project investigation time

*May 18 - May 24:**       Prepare outline/draft of Hacker's Map

*May 25 - May 31:**       Submit Hacker's Map to Mentor, begin(finish?) edits

*June 1 - June 7:**       2nd draft/final of Hacker's Map

*June 8 - June 14:**      2nd draft/final of Hacker's Map

*June 15 - June 21:**     Begin deployment of Hacker's Map

*June 22 - June 27:**     Finish deployment, begin Outreach Phase. **Midterm deadline June 27**

*June 28 - July 5:**      Develop first draft of outreach plan, submit to Mentor, begin edits.

*July 6 - July 12:**      Finish edits, start outreach (Wikidata scavenger hunt to start? Perhaps something to tie in to [Wolfram's Language](www.wolfram.com/language)?)

*July 13 - July 19:**     Monitor outreach results (? is link source data accessible for the Wikidata site?)

*July 20 - July 26:**     Continue with outreach phase. Idea: tweet a daily Wikidata pic that relates to recent news

*July 27 - August 2:**    Find/receive feedback, continue with outreach phase. Idea: highlight a contributor (with permission)

*August 3 - August 10:**  Find/receive feedback, begin results report

**August 11 - August 17:** **Suggested pencils down**, final i-dotting and t-crossing, submit report

**August 18:**           **Final pencils down**, make plans for continued contributions

Include a brief, clear work breakdown structure with milestones and deadlines. Make sure to label deliverables as optional or required. It’s OK to include thinking time (“investigation”) in your work schedule. Deliverables should include investigation, coding, deploying, testing and documentation.

##About you

<!--
We don't just care about your project -- you are a person, and that matters to us! What drives you? What makes you want to make this the '''most awesomest''' wiki enhancement ever?

You don't need to write out your life story (we can read your blog if we want that), but we want to know a little about what makes you tick. Are you a Wikipedia addict wanting to make your own experience better? Did a wiki with usability problems run over your dog, and you're seeking revenge? :-) What does making this project happen mean to you?
-->
I am an independent learner, studying software development. I first came across Wikidata while looking into possible projects for the FOSS OPW. This is actually the third time that I've looked into the FOSS OPW. I gave up on my previous attempts due to the difficulty in know where to start. (I also gave up on my sad little Windows computer but for that backstory, see my entries for last October on my (blog)[http://jaimelynschatz.blogspot.com]. ;) ) There are some amazing resources out there to guide people new to Wikidata, but they can be difficult to navigate and I kept finding myself clicking in circles on the site.

I have a BA in Political Science and Economics from the City University of New York, Brooklyn College. I wanted to become a lawyer and change the world. And then I grew up. But the desire to make a big impact never left me. The main tagline of the Wikimedia Foundation, "We believe that knowledge should be free for every human being" sounds like it came straight from my own heart. (From my heart and from Shira's hacktivist mother in "He, She and It".) I want to help make that knowledge free and accessible to all.

##Participation
<!--
We don't just want to know what you plan to accomplish; we want to know ''how''.  Briefly describe your work style:  how you plan to communicate progress, where you plan to publish your source code while you're working, how and where you plan to ask for help.  (We will tend to favor applicants that demonstrate a clear vision for what it means to be an active participant in our development community.)
-->
##Past open source experience
<!--
Do you have any past experience working in open source projects (MediaWiki or otherwise)?  If so, tell us about it!  If you have already written a feature or bugfix in a Wikimedia technology such as MediaWiki, '''link to it here'''; we will give strong preference to candidates who have done so.
-->
##Any other info
<!--
Please add any other relevant information -- UI mockups, references to related projects, a link to your proof of concept code, whatever. There are no specific requirements, but we love to see people who love what they're doing. Show us you're excited about this project and have an interest in the background and are considering how best to make your idea work.

##Synopsis

####The documentation for Wikidata can be daunting. This project aims to organize the great material that's out there and create a Hacker's Map that details step-by-step how to get started.
<!--
Short summary describing your project: what it means to accomplish, and how it will benefit MediaWiki or Wikimedia projects such as Wikipedia.

##Deliverables

<!--
Include a brief, clear work breakdown structure with milestones and deadlines. Make sure to label deliverables as optional or required. It’s OK to include thinking time (“investigation”) in your work schedule. Deliverables should include investigation, coding, deploying, testing and documentation.
-->
Deploying the map will involve publicizing it to draw in new editors/hackers and use their feedback as part of the testing phase.

##About you

<!--
We don't just care about your project -- you are a person, and that matters to us! What drives you? What makes you want to make this the '''most awesomest''' wiki enhancement ever?

You don't need to write out your life story (we can read your blog if we want that), but we want to know a little about what makes you tick. Are you a Wikipedia addict wanting to make your own experience better? Did a wiki with usability problems run over your dog, and you're seeking revenge? :-) What does making this project happen mean to you?
-->
##Participation
<!--
We don't just want to know what you plan to accomplish; we want to know ''how''.  Briefly describe your work style:  how you plan to communicate progress, where you plan to publish your source code while you're working, how and where you plan to ask for help.  (We will tend to favor applicants that demonstrate a clear vision for what it means to be an active participant in our development community.)
-->
##Past open source experience
<!--
Do you have any past experience working in open source projects (MediaWiki or otherwise)?  If so, tell us about it!  If you have already written a feature or bugfix in a Wikimedia technology such as MediaWiki, '''link to it here'''; we will give strong preference to candidates who have done so.
-->
##Any other info
<!--
Please add any other relevant information -- UI mockups, references to related projects, a link to your proof of concept code, whatever. There are no specific requirements, but we love to see people who love what they're doing. Show us you're excited about this project and have an interest in the background and are considering how best to make your idea work.

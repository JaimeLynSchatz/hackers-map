Education completed or in progress (i.e., university, major/concentration, degree level, and graduation year):
Informally, I am studying programming through several online sources: Udacity for Python, Codecademy and MIcrosoft Virtual Academy for Javascript/CSS/HTML and Ruby/RoR through Learn Ruby the Hard Way and Railstutorial.org. I am Microsoft Certified in JS/CSS/HTML5.

More formally, I have a BA in Political Science with a concentration in Economics (City University of New York, Brooklyn College 1994). I was going to be a lawyer who would change the world. Then I grew up.

How did you hear about this program?
I first heard about the program through a post on Twitter.

We advise all students applying for coding projects to apply for Google Summer of Code as well. Are you planning to apply for Google Summer of Code and, if so, with what organization(s)?
I am not a formal student, so I do not qualify for GSoC.

Please describe your experience with the organization's product as a user and as a contributor (include the information, as well as a link or an attachment, for the required contribution you made to the project you are interested in here):
I have not yet successfully made a contribution to Wikimaps. After spending a couple of weeks (I currently work full time, but I won't this summer) unsuccessfully trying to get the software to run on Vagrant my Windows machine, I finally installed Ubuntu and have it working. I am having a great deal of difficulty finding an appropriate bug to tackle. (I was hoping for a little guidance on that.) I'm using my experience of trying to make a first contribution of code as a baseline for my other project proposals for Wikidata and MediaWiki Labs.

I have just started making contributions to Wikidata and Wikitech, with some mixed results. The difficulty I have had in maing initial contributions to any of the Wikimedia projects has re-emphasized the importance of improving the docs, particularly for brand-new folks (like me.)

Please describe your experience with any other FOSS projects as a user and as a contributor:
I'm a huge fan of FOSS. Like the Wikimedia tagline, I believe that knowledge should be free and accessible to everyone in the world.

I'm just getting started in making contributions to the greater FOSS world, but I've helped a bit with documentation for a few educational resources:
https://github.com/JumpstartLab/curriculum
https://github.com/LibraryCodeYearIG/Codeyear-IG-Github-Project
https://github.com/Ada-Developers-Academy/LessonPlanning

I also participated in a recent Test the Web Forward event where I contributed tests for cross-browser compatibility of the ECMAScript (JavaScript) specification:
https://github.com/tc39/test262/issues/created_by/JaimeLynSchatz?state=open
Regretably, TC39 is on the fence about IP for the contributions generated at that event. See lawyer note above ;).

Please describe any relevant projects that you have worked on previously and what knowledge you gained from working on them (include links):
This would be the first project of it's kind that I have worked on.

I've worked a bit on hobby projects in Rails before (including a very last minute Valentine's present for a friend of a friend: http://dear-mattie.herokuapp.com/.)

What project(s) are you interested in (these can be in the same or different organizations)?
1. OpenHistoricalMaps/Wikimaps Project: https://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=62257. (Project proposal link: https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Historical_OpenStreetMap)
2. Welcoming New Contrib. to Wikimedia Labs/Wikimedia Tools (Project proposal link: https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Labs_Toolbox)
3. Wikidata Outreach: https://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=61991 (Project proposal link: https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Hacker%27s_map)

All three of the projects for which I've developed proposals are with WikiMedia. I love software and coding and I love WikiMedia. If there is a different area with the organization in which the organizers think I would be a better fit, I am ready to learn!

Who is a possible mentor for the project you are most interested in?
I am most interested in the Wikimaps project but I am unsure about my skills. Robert Warren is listed first as a potential mentor for that project.
(Lydia Pintscher is the potential mentor for the Wikidata Doc "Hacker's Map" project and Andrew Bogott for the Wikimedia Labs "Toolbox" project.)

Please describe the details and the timeline of the work you plan to accomplish on the project you are most interested in (discuss these first with the mentor of the project):

The Wikimaps project seeks to draw together data from the OpenStreetMap and OpenHistoricalMaps projects to enable users to view maps backward through the 4th dimension: time. (Allowing users to view maps that reach forward in the 4th dimension is, sadly, out of the scope of this project. ;)

Deliverables

The entire project has three main modules:

1. Enhance the iD and The_Rails_Port so that a javascript time/date slider can be added to control the time period that is of interest.

2. Enhance the ID and The_Rails_Port so that meta-data hooks are added to the code that allow for custom deployments of both software. The intent is to support their use as dedicated user interfaces to certain applications (such as medieval walking path editing) while still using a generic data source.

3. Modify the Mapnik tile renderer to handle Key:start_date and Key:end_date.

As a summer intern, I hope to work with the team to accomplish the following:

May 18 - May 24: Investigation: Get up to speed on the current state of the iD and The_Rails_Port system

May 25 - May 31: Begin a MVP (minimal viable product) of the time slider to ensure I'm on the right track, begin testing and integrating the time slider

June 1 - June 7: Finish testing/integrating the time slider

June 8 - June 14: Investigation: explore what kind of meta-data hooks will be needed to tease out the generic parts of the mapping systems

June 15 - June 21: Start the actual enhancement

June 22 - June 27: Planned SNAFU-fixing time, Midterm deadline June 27

June 28 - July 5: Finish the enhancements and test the system (preferably with a local area for a reality check)

July 6 - July 12: Finish testing and fixing broken bits

July 13 - July 19: Planned SNAFU-fixing time

July 20 - July 26: Introduce new start and end date keys to the Mapnik tile renderer

July 27 - August 2: Continue integrating the keys, testing

August 3 - August 10: Testing and fixing broken bits

August 11 - August 17: Suggested pencils down, final i-dotting and t-crossing, submit report.

August 18: Final pencils down, make plans for continued contributions

This time-breakout needs further input from the potential mentors on the project.

Will you have any other time commitments, such as school work, another job, planned vacation, etc., between May 19 and August 18, 2014?
I currently work full time but expect my job to end on May 26. (I need to stay on long enough to cover a vacation.) In that time (May 19 - May ~26), I expect to be able to work on the project for approximately 4-5 hours a day, 7 days a week.

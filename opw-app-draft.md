Education completed or in progress (i.e., university, major/concentration, degree level, and graduation year):

Informally, I am studying programming through several online sources: Udacity for Python, Codecademy and MIcrosoft Virtual Academy for Javascript/CSS/HTML and Ruby/RoR through Learn Ruby the Hard Way and Railstutorial.org. I am Microsoft Certified in JS/CSS/HTML5.

More formally, I have a BA in Political Science with a concentration in Economics (City University of New York, Brooklyn College 1994). I was going to be a lawyer who would change the world. Then I grew up.

How did you hear about this program?
If memory serves me properly, I first heard about the program through a post on Twitter.

We advise all students applying for coding projects to apply for Google Summer of Code as well. Are you planning to apply for Google Summer of Code and, if so, with what organization(s)?
I am not a formal student, so I do not qualify for GSoC.

Please describe your experience with the organization's product as a user and as a contributor (include the information, as well as a link or an attachment, for the required contribution you made to the project you are interested in here):

I have not yet successfully made a contribution to Wikimaps. After spending a couple of weeks (I currently work full time, but I won't this summer) unsuccessfully trying to get the software to run on Vagrant my Windows machine, I finally installed Ubuntu and have it working. I am having a great deal of difficulty finding an appropriate bug to tackle. (I was hoping for a little guidance on that.) I'm using my experience of trying to make a first contribution of code as a baseline for my proposed Wikidata project.

I have started making contributions to Wikidata, with some mixed results. The difficulty I have had in maing initial contributions to any of the Wikimedia projects has re-emphasized the importance of improving the docs, particularly for brand-new folks (like me.)

My contribution page to WikiLabs is here:

Please describe your experience with any other FOSS projects as a user and as a contributor:
I'm a huge fan of FOSS. Like the Wikimedia tagline, I believe that knowledge should be free and accessible to everyone in the world.

I'm just getting started in making contributions to the greater FOSS world, but I've helped a bit with documentation for a few educational resources:
https://github.com/JumpstartLab/curriculum
https://github.com/LibraryCodeYearIG/Codeyear-IG-Github-Project
https://github.com/Ada-Developers-Academy/LessonPlanning

I also participated in a recent Test the Web Forward event where I contributed tests for cross-browser compatibility of the ECMAScript (JavaScript) specification:
https://github.com/tc39/test262/issues/created_by/JaimeLynSchatz?state=open
Regretably, TC39 is on the fence about IP for the contributions generated at that event. See lawyer note above ;).

Please describe any relevant projects that you have worked on previously and what knowledge you gained from working on them (include links):
This would be the first project of it's kind that I would work on.

I've worked a bit on hobby projects in Rails before (including a very last minute Valentine's present for a friend of a friend: http://dear-mattie.herokuapp.com/.)

What project(s) are you interested in (these can be in the same or different organizations)?
OpenHistoricalMaps/Wikimaps Project: https://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=62257
Welcoming New Contrib. to Wikimedia Labs/Wikimedia Tools
Wikidata Outreach: https://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=61991

Who is a possible mentor for the project you are most interested in?
I am most interested in the Wikimaps project but I am unsure about my skills. Robert Warren is listed first as a potential mentor for that project.
Lydia Pintscher is the potential mentor for the Wikidata Doc ("Hacker's Map") project and Andrew Bogott for the Wikimedia Labs project.

Please describe the details and the timeline of the work you plan to accomplish on the project you are most interested in (discuss these first with the mentor of the project):
from: https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Hacker%27s_map

The documentation for Wikidata (and WikiLabs) can be daunting for new contributors. This project primarily aims to organize the great material that's out there and create a Hacker's Map that details step-by-step how to get started. The Hacker's Map will then be used as part of a mini-campaign to increase participation in the Wikidata project.

Possible mentors
    Lydia Pintscher, WMDE

Deliverables

The first half of the project will involve building the Hacker's Map byt organizing exisiting docs and creating new ones as needed. The second half of the project will center around deploying the map and publicizing it to draw in new editors/hackers and use their feedback as part of the testing/refactoring phase.

April 21 - May 18: On-ramping, project investigation time
May 18 - May 24: Prepare outline/draft of Hacker's Map
May 25 - May 31: Submit Hacker's Map to Mentor, begin(finish?) edits
June 1 - June 7: Begin 2nd draft/final of Hacker's Map
June 8 - June 14: Finish 2nd draft/final of Hacker's map
June 15 - June 21: Begin deployment of Hacker's Map
June 22 - June 27: Finish deployment, begin Outreach Phase. Midterm deadline June 27
June 28 - July 5: Develop first draft of outreach plan, submit to Mentor, begin edits.
July 6 - July 12: Finish edits, start outreach (Wikidata scavenger hunt to start? Perhaps something to tie in to Wolfram's Language?)
July 13 - July 19: Monitor outreach results: is there any discernible increase in activity? Mentions in Twitter or irc?
July 20 - July 26: Continue with outreach phase. Idea: Tweet a daily Wikidata pic that relates to recent news?
July 27 - August 2: Find/receive feedback, continue with outreach phase. Idea: highlight a contributor (with permission)
August 3 - August 10: Find/recieve feedback, begin results report.
August 11 - August 17: Suggested pencils down, final i-dotting and t-crossing, submit report.
August 18: Final pencils down, make plans for continued contributions

Will you have any other time commitments, such as school work, another job, planned vacation, etc., between May 19 and August 18, 2014?
I currently work full time but expect my job to end on May 26. (I need to stay on long enough to cover a vacation.) In that time (May 19 - May ~26), I expect to be able to work on the project for approximately 4-5 hours a day, 7 days a week.

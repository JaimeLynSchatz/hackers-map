What a Summer This Will Be
My name is Jaime Lyn Schatz and through luck and skill and more than a little chutzpah, I am a newly minted intern on the Wikimaps Open [Historial Maps project](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Open_Historical_Map). I will be working with a terrific team of engineers[1] who are volunteering their time to this project, including Robert Warren, who will be my mentor through this journey. I feel deeply honored and incredibly lucky to have this opportunity.

The Wikimaps project seeks to draw together data from the OpenStreetMap and OpenHistoricalMaps projects to enable users to view maps backward through the 4th dimension: time. (Allowing users to view maps that reach forward in the 4th dimension is, sadly, out of the scope of this project. ;) )

The entire project has three main modules:

1.  Enhance the iD, the Javascript map editor, and The_Rails_Port, the OHM backend, so that a javascript time/date slider can be added to control the time period that is of interest.

2.  Enhance the iD and The_Rails_Port so that meta-data hooks are added to the code that allow for custom deployments of both software. This will allow multiple interfaces to be generated from the same data source.

3.  Modify, Mapnik, the software that renders the map images, to handle starting and ending dates for maps shown.

The Wikimaps team explains it with more detail [here](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Open_Historical_Map).

My next steps will be to get up to speed on the nitty-gritty of the iD and The_Rails_Port codebases and to develop a Minimum Viable Product for the time slider. Stay tuned for updates!

Through luck and skill and more than a little chutzpah, I am a newly minted <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/OutreachProgramForWomen/2014/MayAugust">Gnome/FOSS OPW</a> intern on the <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Open_Historical_Map" target="_blank" title="Open Historical Streetmap Project">Open Historical Street Map Project</a>. I will be working with a terrific team of engineers[1] who are volunteering their time to this project, including Robert Warren, who will be my mentor through this journey. I feel deeply honored and incredibly lucky to have this opportunity.<br />
<br />
The Wikimaps project seeks to draw together data from the OpenStreetMap and OpenHistoricalMaps projects to enable users to view maps backward through the 4th dimension: time. (Allowing users to view maps that reach forward in the 4th dimension is, sadly, out of the scope of this project. ;) )<br />
<br />
The entire project has three main modules:<br />
<br />
1. Enhance the iD, the Javascript map editor, and The_Rails_Port, the OHM backend, so that a Javascript time/date slider can be added to control the time period that is of interest.<br />
<br />
2. Enhance the iD and The_Rails_Port so that meta-data hooks are added to the code that allow for custom deployments of both software. This will allow multiple interfaces to be generated from the same data source.<br />
<br />
3. Modify, Mapnik, the software that renders the map images, to handle starting and ending dates for maps shown.<br />
<br />
My next steps will be to get up to speed on the nitty-gritty of the iD and The_Rails_Port code bases and to develop a Minimum Viable Product for the time slider. Stay tuned for updates!<br />

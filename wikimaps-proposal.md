#Wikimaps and OpenHistoricalMap
The Wikimaps project seeks to draw together data from the OpenStreetMap and OpenHistoricalMaps projects to enable users to view maps backward through the 4th dimension: time. (Allowing users to view maps that reach forward in the 4th dimension is, sadly, out of the scope of this project. ;)

##Deliverables

The entire project has three main modules:

1. Enhance the iD and The_Rails_Port so that a javascript time/date slider can be added to control the time period that is of interest.

2. Enhance the ID and The_Rails_Port so that meta-data hooks are added to the code that allow for custom deployments of both software. The intent is to support their use as dedicated user interfaces to certain applications (such as medieval walking path editing) while still using a generic data source.

3. Modify the Mapnik tile renderer to handle Key:start_date and Key:end_date.

As a summer intern, I hope to work with the team to accomplish the following:
May 18 - May 24: Investigation: Get up to speed on the current state of the iD and The_Rails_Port system

**May 25 - May 31**: Begin a MVP (minimal viable product) of the time slider to ensure I'm on the right track, begin testing and integrating the time slider

**June 1 - June 7:** Finish testing/integrating the time slider

**June 8 - June 14:** Investigation: explore what kind of meta-data hooks will be needed to tease out the generic parts of the mapping systems

**June 15 - June 21:** Start the actual enhancement

**June 22 - June 27:** Planned SNAFU-fixing time, Midterm deadline June 27

**June 28 - July 5:** Finish the enhancements and test the system (preferably with a local area for a reality check)

**July 6 - July 12:** Finish testing and fixing broken bits

**July 13 - July 19:** Planned SNAFU-fixing time

**July 20 - July 26:** Introduce new start and end date keys to the Mapnik tile renderer

**July 27 - August 2:** Continue integrating the keys, testing

**August 3 - August 10:** Testing and fixing broken bits

**August 11 - August 17:** Suggested pencils down, final i-dotting and t-crossing, submit report.

**August 18:** Final pencils down, make plans for continued contributions

***This time-breakout needs further input from the potential mentors on the project.***

Will you have any other time commitments, such as school work, another job, planned vacation, etc., between May 19 and August 18, 2014?
I currently work full time but expect my job to end on May 26. (I need to stay on long enough to cover a vacation.) In that time (May 19 - May ~26), I expect to be able to work on the project for approximately 4-5 hours a day, 7 days a week.
